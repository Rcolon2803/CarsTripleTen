This project is a web-based data dashboard that allows users to explore a dataset of used vehicles listed in the United States. The application was built using **Streamlit**, **Plotly Express**, and **Pandas**.

It provides a variety of interactive data visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and sunburst charts to help users understand trends in vehicle price, mileage, condition, and more.
